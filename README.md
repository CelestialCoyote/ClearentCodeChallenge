# ClearentCodeChallenge
Java code challenge for Clearent developer position


Was not able to complete the entire challenge.

Problems to be solved.
1.  Allow multiple wallets to be added to single person.
2.  Finish adding test cases.
    Recieved following error -
    'org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException: No ParameterResolver registered for parameter'
    Could not find a solution.
    
 Has JUnit5.8.1 testing framework as dependency.
